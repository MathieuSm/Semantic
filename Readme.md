# Semantic

This repository provides tools to explore and analyze scientific publications using the Semantic Scholar API (following the tutorial). The project aims to help users quickly gain an overview of a new field of study by identifying key authors and relevant publications. Additionally, it offers scripts to manage personal collections of papers and analyze them based on citation metrics.

## Features

- **Discover Folder**:

## Future Work
