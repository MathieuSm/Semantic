J. Currey;2002;f293abfbb04d8ce7c8277bf5dcdc484ce2622481;Bones: Structure and Mechanics;This is a comprehensive and accessible overview of what is known about the structure and mechanics of bone, bones, and teeth. In it, John Currey incorporates critical new concepts and findings from the two decades of research since the publication of his highly regarded The Mechanical Adaptations of Bones. Crucially, Currey shows how bone structure and bone's mechanical properties are intimately bound up with each other and how the mechanical properties of the material interact with the structure of whole bones to produce an adapted structure.  For bone tissue, the book discusses stiffness, strength, viscoelasticity, fatigue, and fracture mechanics properties. For whole bones, subjects dealt with include buckling, the optimum hollowness of long bones, impact fracture, and properties of cancellous bone. The effects of mineralization on stiffness and toughness and the role of microcracking in the fracture process receive particular attention. As a zoologist, Currey views bone and bones as solutions to the design problems that vertebrates have faced during their evolution and throughout the book considers what bones have been adapted to do. He covers the full range of bones and bony tissues, as well as dentin and enamel, and uses both human and non-human examples

Reisinger;2020;64b23a9eeb05f6ddb6172fc4fb193956b8bda8ef;A Review on Recent Advances in the Constitutive Modeling of Bone Tissue;Image-based finite element analysis (FEA) to predict and understand the biomechanical response has become an essential methodology in musculoskeletal research. An important part of such simulation models is the constitutive material model of which recent advances are summarized in this review. The review shows that existing models from other fields were introduced, such as cohesion zone (cortical bone) or phase-field models (trabecular bone). Some progress has been made in describing cortical bone involving physical mechanisms such as microcracks. Problems with validations at different length scales remain a problem. The improvement of recent constitutive models is partially obscured by uncertainties that affect overall predictions, such as image quality and calibration or boundary conditions. Nevertheless, in vivo CT-based FEA simulations based on a sophisticated constitutive behavior are a very valuable tool for clinical-related osteoporosis research

Fabric tensors aim at modeling through tensors both anisotropy and orientation of a material with respect to another one. Fabric tensors are widely used in fields such as trabecular bone research, mechanics of materials and geology. These tensors can be seen as semi-global measurements since they are computed in relatively large neighborhoods, which are assumed quasi-homogeneous. Many methods have been proposed to compute fabric tensors. We propose to classify fabric tensors into two categories: mechanics-based and morphology-based. The former computes fabric tensors from mechanical simulations, while the latter computes them by analyzing the morphology of the materials. In addition to pointing out advantages and drawbacks for each method, current trends and challenges in this field are also summarized

Hereinto, pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) has a great potential based on the properties of neuronal activities. This paper elaborates internal behaviors of the PCNN to exhibit its image segmentation abilities. There are three significant parts: dynamic properties, parameter setting and complex PCNN. Further, we systematically provide the related segmentation contents of the PCNN, and hope to help researchers to understand suitable segmentation applications of PCNN models. Many corresponding examples are also used to exhibit PCNN segmentation effects

Different from the conventional PCNN, pulse-based radial basis function units are introduced into the model neurons of PCNN to determine the fast links among neurons with respect to their spectral feature vectors and spatial proximity. The computing of the color image segmentation can be implemented in parallel on a field-programmable-gate-array chip. Furthermore, the results of segmentations are applied to an object-detection scheme. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed MPCNN is comparable to those of other popular image segmentation algorithms for the segmentation of noisy images while its parallel neural circuits improve the speed of processing drastically as compared with the sequential-code-based counterparts.
Brian K. Bay;2008;71ec39f4863a8d7d68004a7477af73b540ab93e9;Methods and applications of digital volume correlation;Digital volume correlation, an experimental method for volumetric strain measurement, has experienced a growth in technique development and application since its introduction in 1999. This has largely been the result of more accessible volumetric imaging methods and greater speed and capacity of computational facilities. This paper reviews recent work using the method and presents examples from the author's laboratory. The emerging message is that, although closely related to the surface-oriented method of digital image correlation, the volume method is distinct due to its predominant reliance on naturally occurring image texture for displacement tracking. This requires careful tuning for successful application with different materials, and therefore the appropriate focus should not be on developing the 'best' digital volume correlation method, but on developing a set of tools that can be selected from and adjusted to specific mechanics problems.

In this minireview examples of DVC applications to study the deformation of musculoskeletal tissues at different dimensional scales are reported, highlighting the potential and challenges of this relatively new technique. The manuscript aims at reporting the wide breath of DVC applications in the past 2 decades and discuss future perspective for this unique technique, including fast analysis, applications on soft tissues, high precision approaches, and clinical applications.

Brox;2015;6364fdaa0a0eccd823a779fcdd489173f938e91a;U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation;There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.

This paper provides insight into the internal operations and behaviors of PCNN, and reveals the way how PCNN achieves good performance in digital image processing. The various properties of PCNN are categorized into a novel three-dimensional taxonomy for image processing mechanisms. The first dimension specifies the time matrix of PCNN, the second dimension captures the firing rate of PCNN, and the third dimension is the synchronization of PCNN. Many examples of processing mechanisms are provided to make it clear and concise.
R. Courant;1943;efa32848ae69aba45d37e02b872272b87e36d020;Variational methods for the solution of problems of equilibrium and vibrations;"As Henri Poincare once remarked, ""solution of a mathematical problem"" is a phrase of indefinite meaning. Pure mathematicians sometimes are satisfied with showing that the non-existence of a solution implies a logical contradiction, while engineers might consider a numerical result as the only reasonable goal. Such one sided views seem to reflect human limitations rather than objective values. In itself mathematics is an indivisible organism uniting theoretical contemplation and active application. This address will deal with a topic in which such a synthesis of theoretical and applied mathematics has become particularly convincing. Since Gauss and W. Thompson, the equivalence between boundary value problems of partial differential equations on the one hand and problems of the calculus of variations on the other hand has been a central point in analysis. At first, the theoretical interest in existence proofs dominated and only much later were practical applications envisaged by two physicists, Lord Rayleigh and Walther Ritz ; they independently conceived the idea of utilizing this equivalence for numerical calculation of the solutions, by substituting for the variational problems simpler approximating extremum problems in which but a finite number of parameters need be determined. Rayleigh, in his classical work—Theory of sound—and in other publications, was the first to use such a procedure. But only the spectacular success of Walther Ritz and its tragic circumstances caught the general interest. In two publications of 1908 and 1909 [39], Ritz, conscious of his imminent death from consumption, gave a masterly account of the theory, and at the same time applied his method to the calculation of the nodal lines of vibrating plates, a problem of classical physics that previously had not been satisfactorily treated. Thus methods emerged which could not fail to attract engineers and physicists; after all, the minimum principles of mechanics are more suggestive than the differential equations. Great successes in applications were soon followed by further progress in the understanding of the theoretical background, and such progress in turn must result in advantages for the applications."

While long underestimated, increasing evidence confirms that mechanics plays a critical role in modulating brain function and dysfunction. Computational simulations–based on the field equations of nonlinear continuum mechanics–can provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms of brain injury and disease that go beyond the possibilities of traditional diagnostic tools. Realistic numerical predictions, however, require mechanical models that are capable of capturing the complex and unique characteristics of this ultrasoft, heterogeneous, and active tissue. In recent years, contradictory experimental results have caused confusion and hindered rapid progress. In this review, we carefully assess the challenges associated with brain tissue testing and modeling, and work out the most important characteristics of brain tissue behavior on different length and time scales. Depending on the application of interest, we propose appropriate mechanical modeling approaches that are as complex as necessary but as simple as possible. This comprehensive review will, on the one hand, stimulate the design of new experiments and, on the other hand, guide the selection of appropriate constitutive models for specific applications. Mechanical models that capture the complex behavior of nervous tissues and are accurately calibrated with reliable and comprehensive experimental data are key to performing reliable predictive simulations. Ultimately, mathematical modeling and computational simulations of the brain are useful for both biomedical and clinical communities, and cover a wide range of applications ranging from predicting disease progression and estimating injury risk to planning surgical procedures.

Today, we have dozens of heart tissue models to choose from, but selecting the best model is limited to expert professionals, prone to user bias, and vulnerable to human error. Here we take the human out of the loop and automate the process of model discovery. Towards this goal, we establish a novel incompressible orthotropic constitutive neural network to simultaneously discover both, model and parameters, that best explain human cardiac tissue. Notably, our network features 32 individual terms, 8 isotropic and 24 anisotropic, and fully autonomously selects the best model, out of more than 4 billion possible combinations of terms. We demonstrate that we can successfully train the network with triaxial shear and biaxial extension tests and systematically sparsify the parameter vector with L1-regularization. Strikingly, we robustly discover a four-term model that features a quadratic term in the second invariant I2, and exponential quadratic terms in the fourth and eighth invariants I4f, I4n, and I8fs. Importantly, our discovered model is interpretable by design and has parameters with well-defined physical units. We show that it outperforms popular existing myocardium models and generalizes well, from homogeneous laboratory tests to heterogeneous whole heart simulations. This is made possible by a new universal material subroutine that directly takes the discovered network weights as input. Automating the process of model discovery has the potential to democratize cardiac modeling, broaden participation in scientific discovery, and accelerate the development of innovative treatments for cardiovascular disease.

Kuhl;2022;3de083d97646fb90b569115bedbbaab412e61a39;Automated model discovery for skin: Discovering the best model, data, and experiment;Choosing the best constitutive model and the right set of model parameters is at the heart of continuum mechanics. For decades, the gold standard in constitutive modeling has been to first select a model and then fit its parameters to data. However, the success of this approach is highly dependent on user experience and personal preference. Here we propose a new method that simultaneously and fully autonomously discovers the best model and parameters to explain experimental data. Mathematically, the model finding is translated into a complex non-convex optimization problem. We solve this problem by formulating it as a neural network, and leveraging the success, robustness, and stability of the optimization tools developed in classical neural network modeling. Instead of using a classical off-the-shelf neural network, we design a new family of Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks with activation functions that feature popular constitutive models and parameters that have a clear physical interpretation. Our new network inherently satisfies general kinematic, thermodynamic, and physical constraints and trains robustly, even with sparse data. We illustrate its potential for biaxial extension experiments on skin and demonstrate that the majority of network weights train to zero, while the small subset of non-zero weights defines the discovered model. Unlike classical network weights, these weights are physically interpretable and translate naturally into engineering parameters and microstructural features such as stiffness and fiber orientation. Our results suggest that Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks enable automated model, parameter, and experiment discovery and could initiate a paradigm shift in constitutive modeling, from user-defined to automated model selection and parameterization.

Kuhl;2022;60c9a2b73be151bd622ae1be60fb16e19bb8079b;Automated model discovery for human brain using Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks;The brain is our softest and most vulnerable organ, and understanding its physics is a challenging but significant task. Massive efforts have been dedicated at testing the human brain, and various competing models have emerged to characterize its response to mechanical loading. However, selecting the best constitutive model remains a heuristic process that strongly depends on user experience and personal preference. Here we challenge the conventional wisdom to first select a constitutive model and then fit its parameters to experimental data. Instead, we propose a new strategy that simultaneously discovers both model and parameters that best describe the data. Towards this goal, we integrate more than a century of knowledge in thermodynamics and state-of-the-art machine learning to build a family of Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks that enable automated model discovery for human brain tissue. Our overall design paradigm is to reverse engineer a Constitutive Artificial Neural Network from a set of functional building blocks that are, by design, a generalization of widely used and commonly accepted constitutive models, including the neo Hooke, Blatz Ko, Mooney Rivlin, Demiray, Gent, and Holzapfel models. By constraining the input, output, activation functions, and architecture, our network a priori satisfies thermodynamic consistency, material objectivity, material symmetry, physical constrains, and polyconvexity. We demonstrate that our network autonomously discovers both model and parameters that best characterize the behavior of human gray and white matter under tension, compression, and shear. Importantly, our network weights translate naturally into physically meaningful material parameters, e.g., shear moduli of 1.82kPa, 0.88kPa, 0.94kPa, and 0.54kPa for the cortex, basal ganglia, corona radiata, and corpus callosum. Our results suggest that Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks have the potential to induce a paradigm shift in soft tissue modeling, from user-defined model selection to automated model discovery.

Because of its complex hierarchical structure, bone behaves differently at various length scales. This study aims to compare mechanical properties of human OI bone with healthy control bone at the extracellular matrix (ECM) level and to quantify the influence of the degree of mineralization. Degree of mineralization and mechanical properties were analyzed under dry conditions in 12 fixed and embedded transiliac crest biopsies (control n = 6, OI type I n = 3, OI type IV n = 2, and OI type III n = 1). Mean degree of mineralization was measured by microcomputed tomography at the biopsy level and the mineral‐to‐matrix ratio was assessed by Raman spectroscopy at the ECM level. Both methods revealed that the degree of mineralization is higher for OI bone compared with healthy control. Micropillar compression is a novel technique for quantifying post‐yield properties of bone at the ECM level. Micropillars (d = 5 μm, h = 10 μm) were fabricated using focused ion beam milling and quasi‐statically compressed to capture key post‐yield properties such as ultimate strength. The qualitative inspection of the stress–strain curves showed that both OI and healthy control bone have a ductile response at the ECM level. The quantitative results showed that compressive strength is not reduced in OI bone and is increasing with OI severity. Nanoindentation measurements revealed that OI bone tends to have a higher Young's modulus, hardness, and dissipated energy compared with healthy bone. Micropillar strength and indentation modulus increased linearly and significantly (p < .0001) with mineral‐to‐matrix ratio. In conclusion, this study indicates that compressive mechanical properties of dry OI bone at the iliac crest are not inferior to healthy control at the ECM level and increase with mineralization. © 2021 The Authors.

The materials included fused silica, soda–lime glass, and single crystals of aluminum, tungsten, quartz, and sapphire. It is shown that the load–displacement curves during unloading in these materials are not linear, even in the initial stages, thereby suggesting that the flat punch approximation used so often in the analysis of unloading data is not entirely adequate. An analysis technique is presented that accounts for the curvature in the unloading data and provides a physically justifiable procedure for determining the depth which should be used in conjunction with the indenter shape function to establish the contact area at peak load. The hardnesses and elastic moduli of the six materials are computed using the analysis procedure and compared with values determined by independent means to assess the accuracy of the method. The results show that with good technique, moduli can be measured to within 5%.

Zysset;2009;912291ba4319af746fb628c0b7e659c70573b369;Indentation of bone tissue: a short review;IntroductionBone is a highly hierarchical natural composite material,which mechanical properties are investigated from thephysiological elastic behavior up to impact or fatiguedamage accumulation responsible for traumatic or stressfractures. Each hierarchical level of organization contrib-utes to the global mechanical response of a bone structure:– The mineralized collagen fibril (MCF, 200 nm)– The lamella (2–7 μm)– The bone structural unit (BSU, 60 μm)– Bone tissue, cortical shell, or trabeculae (100–3,000 μm)– Trabecular bone (TB, mm)– Organ (cm)Bone matrix quality becomes a central focus in under-standing the etiology of fractures in diseases such asosteoporosis. Macroscopic indentation was adopted in thefirst half of the 20th century to investigate hardness of boneat the tissue level (compact and trabecular) and wasextended to micro- and nano-indentation in the past 10 yearsto evaluate specific mechanical properties of bone structuralunits and single lamellae, respectively. Over this period oftime, more than 375 papers or reviews were published(Scopus, “*indentation and bone,” June 23rd 2008).Consequently, the objective of this paper is to review therecent progress of indentation techniques to evaluate themechanical properties of human bone at these intermediatelevels of organization.Materials and methodsIndentationIndentation consists in pressing a hard tip with a knownforce into a semi-infinite half-space and measuring directlyor indirectly the contact area. In the classical hardness testperformed at the macroscopic or microscopic level, thecontact area is estimated optically from the imprint createdby the tip on the material and leads to the definition ofhardness as the force divided by this area. The mostcommon hardness measuring indenters are sphere (Brinell,Rockwell), four-sided pyramid (Vickers), and asymmetricpyramid (Knoop).Recent depth-sensing technologies allow for measure-ment of the tip displacement during the indentation processof a semi-infinite half-space with micro- and even nano-precision. Indirect estimation of the contact area is obtainedby preliminary calibration of the tip shape and systemcompliance. Shallow indentation depths down to 100 nmallow for spatial resolution of the measurements in themicron range, and the sample position is typically con-trolled by high-precision motorized tables or piezoelectricscanners. Micro- and nano-indentation tips are often madeof diamond and can be found in spherical, conical, andmost commonly, three-sided pyramidal (Berkovich) shapes.The blunted extremity of the tip has a radius of approxi-mately 100 nm. Spherical tips minimize plastic deformationand damage but are difficult to manufacture, flat puncheslead to high stress concentrations, conical tips have an axialsymmetry that remains in the assumption of most theoret-

The fibrils were deposited on glass substrates that are partly coated with Teflon AF. A modified AFM tip was used to accurately deposit epoxy glue droplets on either end of the collagen fibril that cross the glass-Teflon AF interface, as to such attach it with one end to the glass and the other end to the AFM tip. Single collagen fibrils have been mechanically tested in ambient conditions and were found to behave reversibly up to stresses of 90 MPa. Within this regime a Young's modulus of 2-7 GPa was obtained. In aqueous media, the collagen fibrils could be tested reversibly up to about 15 MPa, revealing Young's moduli ranging from 0.2 to at most 0.8 GPa.

Since the indentation modulus depends on all elastic constants and, for anisotropic materials, also on the indentation direction, a theoretical model quantifying the indentation modulus from the stiffness tensor of a given material was implemented numerically (Swadener and Pharr, 2001, """"Indentation of Elastically Anisotropic Half-Spaces by Cones and Parabolae of Revolution,"""" Philos. Mag. A, 81(2), pp. 447-466). Nanoindentation was performed on 22 osteons of the distal femoral shaft: A new holding system was designed in order to indent the same osteon in two orthogonal directions. To interpret the experimental results and identify orthotropic elastic constants, an inverse procedure was developed by using a fabric-based elastic model for lamellar bone. The experimental indentation moduli were found to vary with the indentation direction and showed a marked anisotropy. The estimated elastic constants showed different degrees of anisotropy among secondary osteons of the same bone and these degrees of anisotropy were also found to be different than the one of cortical bone at the macroscopic level. Using the log-Euclidean norm, the relative distance between the compliance tensors of the estimated mean osteon and of cortical bone at the macroscopic level was 9.69%: Secondary osteons appeared stiffer in their axial and circumferential material directions, and with a greater bulk modulus than cortical bone, which is attributed to the absence of vascular porosity in osteonal properties. The proposed method is suitable for identification of elastic constants from nanoindentation experiments and could be adapted to other (bio)materials, for which it is possible to describe elastic properties using a fabric-based model."

A micromechanics-based multiscale homogenization scheme proposed by Reisinger et al. is used to obtain the effective elastic properties of lamellar bone. The dissipative process in bone is modeled as viscoplastic deformation coupled to damage. The model is based on an orthotropic ecuntric elliptical criterion in stress space. In order to simplify material identification, an eccentric elliptical isotropic yield surface was defined in strain space, which is transformed to a stress-based criterion by means of the damaged compliance tensor. Viscoplasticity is implemented by means of the continuous Perzyna formulation. Damage is modeled by a scalar function of the accumulated plastic strain \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${D(\kappa)}$$\end{document} , reducing all element s of the stiffness matrix. A polynomial flow rule is proposed in order to capture the rate-dependent post-yield behavior of lamellar bone. A numerical algorithm to perform the back projection on the rate-dependent yield surface has been developed and implemented in the commercial finite element solver Abaqus/Standard as a user subroutine UMAT. A consistent tangent operator has been derived and implemented in order to ensure quadratic convergence. Correct implementation of the algorithm, convergence, and accuracy of the tangent operator was tested by means of strain- and stress-based single element tests. A finite element simulation of nano- indentation in lamellar bone was finally performed in order to show the abilities of the newly developed constitutive model.

Zysset;2013;fb18768a144f7f4dd3ca48a8d76e6f5faaf55ad2;A generalized anisotropic quadric yield criterion and its application to bone tissue at multiple length scales;Nonlinear computational analysis of materials showing elasto-plasticity or damage relies on knowledge of their yield behavior and strengths under complex stress states. In this work, a generalized anisotropic quadric yield criterion is proposed that is homogeneous of degree one and takes a convex quadric shape with a smooth transition from ellipsoidal to cylindrical or conical surfaces. If in the case of material identification, the shape of the yield function is not known a priori, a minimization using the quadric criterion will result in the optimal shape among the convex quadrics. The convexity limits of the criterion and the transition points between the different shapes are identified. Several special cases of the criterion for distinct material symmetries such as isotropy, cubic symmetry, fabric-based orthotropy and general orthotropy are presented and discussed. The generality of the formulation is demonstrated by showing its degeneration to several classical yield surfaces like the von Mises, Drucker–Prager, Tsai–Wu, Liu, generalized Hill and classical Hill criteria under appropriate conditions. Applicability of the formulation for micromechanical analyses was shown by transformation of a criterion for porous cohesive-frictional materials by Maghous et al. In order to demonstrate the advantages of the generalized formulation, bone is chosen as an example material, since it features yield envelopes with different shapes depending on the considered length scale. A fabric- and density-based quadric criterion for the description of homogenized material behavior of trabecular bone is identified from uniaxial, multiaxial and torsional experimental data. Also, a fabric- and density-based Tsai–Wu yield criterion for homogenized trabecular bone from in silico data is converted to an equivalent quadric criterion by introduction of a transformation of the interaction parameters. Finally, a quadric yield criterion for lamellar bone at the microscale is identified from a nanoindentation study reported in the literature, thus demonstrating the applicability of the generalized formulation to the description of the yield envelope of bone at multiple length scales.

The proposed model which mathematical formulation is established within the framework of generalized standard materials accounts for three distinct material evolution modes where elastic, plastic and damage aspects are closely related. The anisotropic elasticity of bone is described by a morphology-based model and distinct damage behaviour in tension and compression by a halfspacewise generalized Hill criterion. The plastic criterion is based on the intact elastic compliance tensor. The algorithm applies three distinct projections based on the relationship between the internal variables and criteria. Their respective consistent tangent operators are presented. Numerical resolutions of several boundary value problems and a biomechanical application are presented to illustrate the potential of the constitutive model and demonstrate the expected quadratic convergence of the algorithm.

For these materials the identification of the type of elastic symmetry is complicated by the variable composition of the material. The data analysis method permits the identification of the type of elastic symmetry to be accomplished independent of the examination of the variable composition. This method of analysis may be applied to any set of elastic constant measurements, but is illustrated here by application to hardwoods and softwoods, and to an extraordinary data base of cancellous bone elastic constants. The solid volume fraction or bulk density is the compositional variable for the elastic constants of these natural materials. The final results are the solid volume fraction dependent orthotropic Hooke's law for cancellous bone and a bulk density dependent one for hardwoods and softwoods.

Bone fracture is a complex phenomenon due to the composite, inhomogeneous and hierarchical structure of bone. First, we briefly summarize the hierarchical structure of bone, spanning from the nanoscale, sub-microscale, microscale, mesoscale to the macroscale, and discuss experimental observations on failure mechanisms in bone at these scales. Then, we highlight representative analytical and computational models of bone fracture and strength at different length scales and discuss the main findings in the context of experiments. We conclude by summarizing the challenges in modelling of bone fracture and strength and list open topics for scientific exploration. Modelling of bone, accounting for different scales, provides new and needed insights into the fracture and strength of bone, which, in turn, can lead to improved diagnostic tools and treatments of bone diseases such as osteoporosis.

Breiman;2001;8e0be569ea77b8cb29bb0e8b031887630fe7a96c;Random Forests;Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.

Other minerals are also known to nucleate within collagen in vitro. For a series of strontium- and calcium-based minerals, we observed that their precipitation leads to a contraction of collagen fibrils, reaching stresses as large as several megapascals. The magnitude of the stress depends on the type and amount of mineral. Using in-operando synchrotron x-ray scattering, we analyzed the kinetics of mineral deposition. Whereas no contraction occurs when the mineral deposits outside fibrils only, intrafibrillar mineralization generates fibril contraction. This chemomechanical effect occurs with collagen fully immersed in water and generates a mineral-collagen composite with tensile fibers, reminiscent of the principle of reinforced concrete. Description Key aspects of bone mineralization Bone is a hierarchical material consisting of a organic fibers, mainly in the form of collagen, that are mineralized with inorganic crystals, primarily hydroxyapatite. It is this structure that gives bone its remarkable combination of strength and toughness. Ping et al. examined the deposition of minerals on both the outside and inside of the fibers over time (see the Perspective by Nudelman and Kröger). They found that large contractile forces occur within the collagen during intrafibrillar mineralization regardless of the mineral type, thus giving bone its unusual combination of mechanical properties. This feature is analogous to the reinforcement of concrete using prestressed steel rods. —MSL In bone, the precipitation of various minerals inside collagen causes contraction of the fibrils, thus reinforcing them.
R. Huiskes;2000;5b3b9db380327b1f5a91d307102a3682d4f9d4e8;If bone is the answer, then what is the question?;"In the 19th century, several scientists attempted to relate bone trabecular morphology to its mechanical, load‐bearing function. It was suggested that bone architecture was an answer to requirements of optimal stress transfer, pairing maximal strength to minimal weight, according to particular mathematical design rules. Using contemporary methods of analysis, stress transfer in bones was studied and compared with anatomical specimens, from which it was hypothesised that trabecular architecture is associated with stress trajectories. Others focused on the biological processes by which trabecular architectures are formed and on the question of how bone could maintain the relationship between external load and architecture in a variable functional environment. Wilhelm Roux introduced the principle of functional adaptation as a self‐organising process based in the tissues. Julius Wolff, anatomist and orthopaedic surgeon, entwined these 3 issues in his book The Law of Bone Remodeling (translation), which set the stage for biomechanical research goals in our day. ‘Wolff's Law’ is a question rather than a law, asking for the requirements of structural optimisation. In this article, based on finite element analysis (FEA) results of stress transfer in bones, it is argued that it was the wrong question, putting us on the wrong foot. The maximal strength/minimal weight principle does not provide a rationale for architectural formation or adaptation; the similarity between trabecular orientation and stress trajectories is circumstantial, not causal. Based on computer simulations of bone remodelling as a regulatory process, governed by mechanical usage and orchestrated by osteocyte mechanosensitivity, it is shown that Roux's paradigm, conversely, is a realistic proposition. Put in a quantitative regulatory context, it can predict both trabecular formation and adaptation. Hence, trabecular architecture is not an answer to Wolff's question, in the sense of this article's title. There are no mathematical optimisation rules for bone architecture; there is just a biological regulatory process, producing a structure adapted to mechanical demands by the nature of its characteristics, adequate for evolutionary endurance. It is predicted that computer simulation of this process can help us to unravel its secrets."

Hollister;1998;dea8075cc7fa43811b84cff0fde8ee2cc42e78eb;A global relationship between trabecular bone morphology and homogenized elastic properties.;An alternative concept of the relationship between morphological and elastic properties of trabecular bone is presented and applied to human tissue from several anatomical locations using a digital approach. The three-dimensional morphology of trabecular bone was assessed with a microcomputed tomography system and the method of directed secants as well as the star volume procedure were used to compute mean intercept length (MIL) and average bone length (ABL) of 4 mm cubic specimens. Assuming isotropic elastic properties for the trabecular tissue, the general elastic tensors of the bone specimens were determined using the homogenization method and the closest orthotropic tensors were calculated with an optimization algorithm. The assumption of orthotropy for trabecular bone was found to improve with specimen size and hold within 6.1 percent for a 4 mm cube size. A strong global relationship (r2 = 0.95) was obtained between fabric and the orthotropic elastic tensor with a minimal set of five constants. Mean intercept length and average bone length provided an equivalent power of prediction. These results support the hypothesis that the elastic properties of human trabecular bone from an arbitrary anatomical location can be estimated from an approximation of the anisotropic morphology and a prior knowledge of tissue properties.

During bone formation and remodeling, osteoblasts get embedded into the matrix they deposit and differentiate to osteocytes. These cells form a dense network throughout the entire bone material. Osteocytes are known to orchestrate bone remodeling. However, the precise role of osteocytes during mineral homeostasis and their potential influence on bone material quality remains unclear. To understand the mutual influence of osteocytes and extracellular matrix, it is crucial to reveal their network organization in relation to the properties of their surrounding material. Here we visualize and topologically quantify the osteocyte network in mineralized bone sections with confocal laser scanning microscopy. At the same region of the sample, synchrotron small‐angle X‐ray scattering is used to determine nanoscopic bone mineral particle size and arrangement relative to the cell network. Major findings are that most of the mineral particles reside within less than a micrometer from the nearest cell network channel and that mineral particle characteristics depend on the distance from the cell network. The architecture of the network reveals optimization with respect to transport costs between cells and to blood vessels. In conclusion, these findings quantitatively show that the osteocyte network provides access to a huge mineral reservoir in bone due to its dense organization. The observed correlation between the architecture of osteocyte networks and bone material properties supports the hypothesis that osteocytes interact with their mineralized vicinity and thus, participate in bone mineral homeostasis.

This challenging task requires a physically rigorous and mathematically sound basis, as provided by Finite Element and Fast Fourier Transform methods, as well as by continuum micromechanics resting on (semi-)analytical solutions for Eshelby-type matrix-inclusion problems. Corresponding numerical and analytical mathematical models have undergone diligent experimental validation, by means of data stemming from a variety of biophysical, biochemical, and biomechanical testing methods, such as light and electron microscopy, ultrasonic testing and scanning acoustic microscopy, as well as physico-chemical tests associated with dehydration, demineralization, decollagenization, ashing, and weighing in air and fluid. While elastic scale transition and homogenization methods have attained a high maturity level, the hierarchical nature of dissipative (i.e. viscous or strength) properties is still a vibrant field of research. This applies even more to hierarchical approaches elucidating the interface between biological cells and extracellular matrices, and to the highly undiscovered mechanics unfolding within biological cells."

Bone has evolved to provide structural support to organisms, and therefore its mechanical properties are vital physiologically. Like many mineralized tissues, bone can resist deformation and fracture from the nature of its hierarchical structure, which spans molecular to macroscopic length‐scales. In fact, bone derives its fracture resistance with a multitude of deformation and toughening mechanisms that are active at most of these dimensions. It is shown that bone's strength and ductility originate primarily at the scale of the nano to submicrometer structure of its mineralized collagen fibrils and fibers, whereas bone toughness is additionally generated at much larger, micro‐ to near‐millimeter, scales from crack‐tip shielding associated with interactions between the crack path and the microstructure. It is further shown how the effectiveness with which bone's structural features can resist fracture at small to large length‐scales can become degraded by biological factors such as aging and disease, which affect such features as the collagen cross‐linking environment, the homogeneity of mineralization, and the density of the osteonal structures.

Postmenopausal and age-related osteoporosis/osteopenia is a major contributor to the risk of such fractures. Since cortical bone is the major load bearing tissue, the effects of age, gender, and pathological changes on the mechanical competence of cortical bone tissues have been of great interest to bone researchers. This chapter provides the information on the current understanding of the micro/ultrastructural and compositional properties and their contribution to the bulk mechanical (elastic, plastic, and viscous) behavior of cortical bone tissues. In addition, the effect of age and gender on the structural/compositional properties and their impacts on the mechanical competence of cortical bone are also discussed

Laugier;2011;f8c2eb6866be1ff28af8dafab5d88a20917d1471;A determination of the minimum sizes of representative volume elements for the prediction of cortical bone elastic properties;At its highest level of microstructural organization—the mesoscale or millimeter scale—cortical bone exhibits a heterogeneous distribution of pores (Haversian canals, resorption cavities). Multi-scale mechanical models rely on the definition of a representative volume element (RVE). Analytical homogenization techniques are usually based on an idealized RVE microstructure, while finite element homogenization using high-resolution images is based on a realistic RVE of finite size. The objective of this paper was to quantify the size and content of possible cortical bone mesoscale RVEs. RVE size was defined as the minimum size: (1) for which the apparent (homogenized) stiffness tensor becomes independent of the applied boundary conditions or (2) for which the variance of elastic properties for a set of microstructure realizations is sufficiently small. The field of elastic coefficients and microstructure in RVEs was derived from one acoustic microscopy image of a human femur cortical bone sample with an overall porosity of 8.5%. The homogenized properties of RVEs were computed with a finite element technique. It was found that the size of the RVE representative of the overall tissue is about 1.5 mm. Smaller RVEs (~0.5 mm) can also be considered to estimate local mesoscopic properties that strongly depend on the local pores volume fraction. This result provides a sound basis for the application of homogenization techniques to model the heterogeneity of cortical microstructures. An application of the findings to estimate elastic properties in the case of a porosity gradient is briefly presented

Bone is a multifunctional material which among its other functions serves as a support for other tissues in the body. As a structural material it is stiff, strong, tough, lightweight and is adaptable. Its excellent mechanical properties are due to its complex, composite and hierarchical structure. In this paper, we outline the experimental approaches that have been used to characterize bone's structure, composition and elastic properties at several different length scales. Then, we discuss different modeling approaches that have been employed to compute bone’s elastic moduli. We conclude by discussing the challenges and open issues in this area. Analysis of bone is of importance in orthopedics. Also, gained knowledge on bone can be used by engineers to design new bioinspired composite materials for a wide range of engineering applications.

The elastic stiffness coefficients were determined experimentally from ultrasonic velocity measurements on 96 samples of normal cortical bone removed from the right tibia of eight human cadavers. The following measured values were used for our analysis: c11=19.5 GPa, c22=20.1 GPa, c33=30.9 GPa, c44=5.72 GPa, c55=5.17 GPa, c66=4.05 GPa, c23=12.5 GPa. The remaining coefficients were determined by assuming that the specimens possessed at least an orthorhombic elastic symmetry, and further assuming that c13=c23, c12=c11–2c66. Our analysis revealed a substantial anisotropy in Young's modulus in the plane containing the long axis of the tibia, with maxima of 20.9 GPa parallel to the long axis, and minima of 11.8 GPa perpendicular to this axis. A less pronounced anisotropy was observed in the plane perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia. To display our results for the full three-dimensional anisotropy of cortical bone, a closed surface was used to represent Young's modulus in all spatial directions

As such, deterioration in mechanical behavior with aging and/or diseases such as osteoporosis and diabetes can have profound consequences for individuals' quality of life. This article reviews current knowledge of the basic mechanical behavior of bone at length scales ranging from hundreds of nanometers to tens of centimeters. We present the basic tenets of bone mechanics and connect them to some of the arcs of research that have brought the field to recent advances. We also discuss cortical bone, trabecular bone, and whole bones, as well as multiple aspects of material behavior, including elasticity, yield, fracture, fatigue, and damage. We describe the roles of bone quantity (e.g., density, porosity) and bone quality (e.g., cross-linking, protein composition), along with several avenues of future research.

This disease leads to impaired trabecular architecture and increased fracture risk. It is essential to understand how morphological and mechanical properties of the cancellous bone are related. Morphology‐elasticity relationships based on bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and fabric anisotropy explain up to 98% of the variation in elastic properties. Yet, other morphological variables such as individual trabeculae segmentation (ITS) and trabecular bone score (TBS) could improve the stiffness predictions. A total of 743 micro–computed tomography (μCT) reconstructions of cubic trabecular bone samples extracted from femur, radius, vertebrae, and iliac crest were analyzed. Their morphology was assessed via 25 variables and their stiffness tensor ( CFE ) was computed from six independent load cases using micro finite element (μFE) analyses. Variance inflation factors were calculated to evaluate collinearity between morphological variables and decide upon their inclusion in morphology‐elasticity relationships. The statistically admissible morphological variables were included in a multiple linear regression model of the dependent variable CFE . The contribution of each independent variable was evaluated (ANOVA). Our results show that BV/TV is the best determinant of CFE (r2adj = 0.889), especially in combination with fabric anisotropy (r2adj = 0.968). Including the other independent predictors hardly affected the amount of variance explained by the model (r2adj = 0.975). Across all anatomical sites, BV/TV explained 87% of the variance of the bone elastic properties. Fabric anisotropy further described 10% of the bone stiffness, but the improvement in variance explanation by adding other independent factors was marginal (<1%). These findings confirm that BV/TV and fabric anisotropy are the best determinants of trabecular bone stiffness and show, against common belief, that other morphological variables do not bring any further contribution. These overall conclusions remain to be confirmed for specific bone diseases and postelastic properties. © 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Micro-finite element (μFE) modeling can be used to study the apparent elastic behavior of human cancellous bone. In this study, samples from the femur, radius and vertebral body were investigated to evaluate the predictive power of morphology–elasticity relationships and to compare them across different anatomical regions. μFE models of 701 trabecular bone cubes with a side length of 5.3 mm were analyzed using kinematic boundary conditions. Based on the FE results, four morphology–elasticity models using bone volume fraction as well as full, limited or no fabric information were calibrated for each anatomical region. The 5 parameter Zysset–Curnier model using full fabric information showed excellent predictive power with coefficients of determination (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${r_{\rm adj}^2}$$\end{document}) of 0.98, 0.95 and 0.94 of the femur, radius and vertebra data, respectively, with mean total norm errors between 14 and 20%. A constant orthotropy model and a constant transverse isotropy model, where the elastic anisotropy is defined by the model parameters, yielded coefficients of determination between 0.90 and 0.98 with total norm errors between 16 and 25%. Neglecting fabric information and using an isotropic model led to \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${r_{\rm adj}^2}$$\end{document} between 0.73 and 0.92 with total norm errors between 38 and 49%. A comparison of the model regressions revealed minor but significant (p<0.01) differences for the fabric–elasticity model parameters calibrated for the different anatomical regions. The proposed models and identified parameters can be used in future studies to compute the apparent elastic properties of human cancellous bone for homogenized FE models

The main conclusions which can be drawn from our results are: (1) In agreement with Gebhardt's theories the ultimate compressive strength is greatest for osteons having transversally oriented fiber bundles, lowest for osteons having longitudinally oriented fiber bundles, and intermediate for osteons whose fiber bundles change direction in successive lamellae through an angle of about 90°. (2) The modulus of elasticity is greatest in osteons with transversally oriented fiber bundles. (3) With all three types of osteon the stress‐strain curves for fully calcified osteons are markedly different from those for osteons with low calcium content, the modulus of elasticity being much lower in osteons of the latter type. (4) Age seems to have no measurable influence on the compressive properties of osteons. (5) The comparison of compressive properties in single osteons and in macroscopic bone samples seems to support the view that the osteon is actually the mechanical unit of compact bone. (6) Fracture in osteon samples starts with microscopic fissures induced by shearing. (7) In every case these fissures form an angle of roughly 30°–35° with the axis of the osteon and do not appear to vary with the microscopic osteon structures. (8) Electron microscopy reveals distortion of bone crystals and breaking of collagen fibrils at the edges of the fissures.

The results were related to the degree of calcification and the orientation of collagen fiber‐bundles in successive lamellae of the osteons. The following conclusions were made: (1) When osteon specimens are dried, their tensile strength and modulus of elasticity increase, while their percent elongation under tension falls. (2) In the osteon samples tested wet, the degree of calcification induces an increase in the modulus of elasticity with additional amounts of calcium salts. (3) The modulus of elasticity in tension of the organic matrix corresponds to that of collagen. (4) In the osteons having a marked longitudinal arrangement of bundles of fibers in successive lamellae, the ultimate tensile strength and modulus of elasticity seem greater and the percentage elongation under tension seems lower than in osteons whose bundles in successive lamellae change through an angle of about 90°. (5) The tensile properties of osteons seem independent of the age of the subject. (6) Human and ox osteons reveal the same tensile behavior. (7) The tensile stress‐strain curves show that, even at the level of single osteons, bone behaves like a complex material, which, according to Sedlin, can be represented by a Hooke body linked in series to a Kelvin body.

The results Were related to the degree of calcification and the orientation of collagen fiber bundles in successive lamellae of the osteons. The following conclusions were made: (1) Osteons having a marked longitudinal spiral course of fiber bundles in successive lamellae are least able to support shearing stress. This suggests that in the other types of osteon the compactness of bone is strengthened by the lamellae having marked transversal spiral course of the fiber bundles. (2)Ultimate shearing strength and modulus of elasticity of osteons increase as calcification proceeds. (3) The shearing strength of single osteons is markedly lower than the tensile and compressive strength for samples of the same type. (4) In osteons loaded along their axis the range of elastic deformation is barely more than 1% of the length of the sample. (5) With the technical procedure used in this investigation the shearing of osteons appears to be preferentially related to the lamellar structure. In osteons loaded excentrically the portions which have slipped out have a rather irregular shape and in many cases one or two fractures occur. (6) The resistance to shearing of the cementing substance at the boundaries of the osteon may be greater than the resistance of the osteon itself.

ABSTRACT Purpose Physical activity benefits bone mass and cortical bone size. The current study assessed the impact of chronic (≥10 yr) physical activity on trabecular microarchitectural properties and microfinite element analyses of estimated bone strength. Methods Female collegiate-level tennis players (n = 15; age = 20.3 ± 0.9 yr) were used as a within-subject controlled model of chronic unilateral upper-extremity physical activity. Racquet-to-nonracquet arm differences at the distal radius and radial diaphysis were assessed using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography. The distal tibia and the tibial diaphysis in both legs were also assessed, and cross-country runners (n = 15; age = 20.8 ± 1.2 yr) included as controls. Results The distal radius of the racquet arm had 11.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.9% to 15.7%) greater trabecular bone volume/tissue volume, with trabeculae that were greater in number, thickness, connectivity, and proximity to each other than that in the nonracquet arm (all P < 0.01). Combined with enhanced cortical bone properties, the microarchitectural advantages at the distal radius contributed a 18.7% (95% CI = 13.0% to 24.4%) racquet-to-nonracquet arm difference in predicted load before failure. At the radial diaphysis, predicted load to failure was 9.6% (95% CI = 6.7% to 12.6%) greater in the racquet versus nonracquet arm. There were fewer and smaller side-to-side differences at the distal tibia; however, the tibial diaphysis in the leg opposite the racquet arm was larger with a thicker cortex and had 4.4% (95% CI = 1.7% to 7.1%) greater strength than the contralateral leg. Conclusion Chronically elevated physical activity enhances trabecular microarchitecture and microfinite element estimated strength, furthering observations from short-term longitudinal studies. The data also demonstrate that tennis players exhibit crossed symmetry wherein the leg opposite the racquet arm possesses enhanced tibial properties compared with in the contralateral leg."

M. Balda;2020;b8f3db259c8ac35c8cb1c8fcac7379ae96f36399;Quantitative Computed Tomography;Computed Tomography (CT) is a wide-spread medical imaging modality. Traditional CT yields information on a patient’s anatomy in form of slice images or volume data. Hounsfield Units (HU) are used to quantify the imaged tissue properties. Due to the polychromatic nature of X-rays in CT, the HU values for a specific tissue depend on its density and composition but also on CT system parameters and settings and the surrounding materials. The main objective of Quantitative CT (QCT) is measuring characteristic physical tissue or material properties quantitatively. These characteristics can, for instance, be density of contrast agents or local X-ray attenuation. Quantitative measurements enable specific medical applications such as perfusion diagnostic or attenuation correction for Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This work covers three main topics of QCT. After a short introduction to the physical and technological basics for QCT, we focus on spectral X-ray detection for CT. Here, we introduce two simulation concepts for spectral CT detectors, one for integrating scintillation and one for directly-converting counting detectors. These concepts are tailored specifically for the examined detector type and are supported by look-up tables. They enable whole scan simulations about 200 times quicker than standard particle interaction simulations without sacrificing the desired precision. These simulations can be used to optimize detector parameters with respect to the quality of the reconstructed final result. The results were verified with data from real detectors, prototypes and measuring stations. The second topic is QCT algorithms which use spectral CT data to realize QCT applications. The core concept introduced here is Local Spectral Reconstruction (LSR). LSR is an iterative reconstruction scheme which yields an analytic characterization of local spectral attenuation properties in object space. From this characterization, various quantitative measures can be computed. Within this theoretical framework, various QCT applications can be formulated. This is demonstrated for quantitative beam-hardening correction, PET and SPECT attenuation correction and material identification. The final part is dedicated to noise reduction for QCT. In CT noise reduction is directly linked to patient dose saving. Here, we introduce two novel techniques: Firstly an image-based noise reduction based on joint histograms of multi-energy data-sets. This method explicitly incorporates the typical signal properties of multispectral data. We demonstrate a dose saving potential of 20% on real and synthetic data. The second method is a non-linear filter applied to projection data. It uses a point-based projection model to identify and preserve structures in the projection domain. This principle is applied to a modified bilateral filter, where the photometric similarity measure is replaced with a structural similarity measure derived from this concept. We examine the properties of this filter on synthetic and real patient data. We get a noise reduction potential of about 15% without sacrificing image sharpness. This is verified on synthetic data and real phantom and patient scans.

A number of imaging methods exist and all have advantages and disadvantages. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the most widely available and commonly utilized method for clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis and will remain so for the foreseeable future. The WHO 10-year fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX®) will improve clinical use of DXA and the cost-effectiveness of therapeutic intervention. Improved reporting of radiographic features that suggest osteoporosis and the presence of vertebral fracture, which are powerful predictors of future fractures, could increase the frequency of appropriate DXA referrals. Quantitative CT remains predominantly a research tool, but has advantages over DXA—allowing measurement of volumetric density, separate measures of cortical and trabecular bone density, and evaluation of bone shape and size. High resolution imaging, using both CT and MRI, has been introduced to measure trabecular and cortical bone microstructure. Although these methods provide detailed insights into the effects of disease and therapies on bone, they are technically challenging and not widely available, so they are unlikely to be used in clinical practice

Schneider;2020;80708f2ab7eeaf1bea99e6c56259a4e6681b1772;Quantifying intracortical bone microstructure: A critical appraisal of 2D and 3D approaches for assessing vascular canals and osteocyte lacunae;Describing and quantifying vascular canal orientation and volume of osteocyte lacunae in bone is important in studies of bone growth, mechanics, health and disease. It is also an important element in analysing fossil bone in palaeohistology, key to understanding the growth, life and death of extinct animals. Often, bone microstructure is studied using two‐dimensional (2D) sections, and three‐dimensional (3D) shape and orientation of structures are estimated by modelling the structures using idealised geometries based on information from their cross sections. However, these methods rely on structures meeting strict geometric assumptions. Recently, 3D methods have been proposed which could provide a more accurate and robust approach to bone histology, but these have not been tested in direct comparison with their 2D counterparts in terms of accuracy and sensitivity to deviations from model assumptions. We compared 2D and 3D methodologies for estimating key microstructural traits using a combination of experimental and idealised test data sets. We generated populations of cylinders (canals) and ellipsoids (osteocyte lacunae), varying the cross‐sectional aspect ratios of cylinders and orientation of ellipsoids to test sensitivity to deviations from cylindricality and longitudinal orientation, respectively. Using published methods, based on 2D sections and 3D data sets, we estimated cylinder orientation and ellipsoid volume. We applied the same methods to six CT data sets of duck cortical bone, using the full volumes for 3D measurements and single CT slices to represent 2D sections. Using in silico test data sets that did deviate from ideal cylinders and ellipsoids resulted in inaccurate estimates of cylinder or canal orientation, and reduced accuracy in estimates of ellipsoid and lacunar volume. These results highlight the importance of using appropriate 3D imaging and quantitative methods for quantifying volume and orientation of 3D structures and offer approaches to significantly enhance our understanding of bone physiology based on accurate measures for bone microstructures.

Several techniques for assessing bone quality have been described in the literature. This study aims to systematically summarize the methods currently available for assessing bone quality in human bone tissue, and to discuss the advantages and limitations of these techniques. Methods A systematic review of the literature was carried out by searching the PubMed and Web of Science databases from January 2000 to April 2021. References will be screened and evaluated for eligibility by two independent reviewers as per PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Studies must apply to bone quality assessment with imaging techniques, mechanical testing modalities, and compositional characterization. The terms used for the systematic search were: “(bone quality”. Ti,ab.) AND “(human bone specimens)”. Results The systematic review identified 502 relevant articles in total. Sixty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria. Among them, forty-seven articles investigated several imaging modalities, including radiography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), CT-based techniques, and MRI-based methods. Nineteen articles dealt with mechanical testing approaches, including traditional testing modalities and novel indentation techniques. Nine articles reported the correlation between bone quality and compositional characterization, such as degree of bone mineralization (DBM) and organic composition. A total of 2898 human cadaveric bone specimens were included. Conclusions Advanced techniques are playing an increasingly important role due to their multiple advantages, focusing on the assessment of bone morphology and microarchitecture. Non-invasive imaging modalities and mechanical testing techniques, as well as the assessment of bone composition, need to complement each other to provide comprehensive and ideal information on the bone quality of human bone specimens.

Osteocyte processes are thought to sense the flow of interstitial fluid that is driven through the osteocyte canaliculi by mechanical stimuli placed upon bone, but how this flow elicits a cellular response is virtually unknown. Modern theoretical models assume that osteocyte canaliculi contain ultrastructural features that amplify the fluid flow-derived mechanical signal. Unfortunately the calcified bone matrix has considerably hampered studies on the osteocyte process within its canaliculus. Using one of the few ultra high voltage electron microscopes (UHVEM) available worldwide, we applied UHVEM tomography at 2 MeV to reconstruct unique three-dimensional images of osteocyte canaliculi in 1 μm sections of human bone. A realistic three-dimensional image-based model of a single canaliculus was constructed, and the fluid dynamics of a Newtonian fluid flow within the canaliculus was analyzed. We created virtual 2.2 nm thick sections through a canaliculus and found that traditional TEM techniques create a false impression that osteocyte processes are directly attached to the canalicular wall. The canalicular wall had a highly irregular surface and contained protruding axisymmetric structures similar in size and shape to collagen fibrils. We also found that the microscopic surface roughness of the canalicular wall strongly influenced the fluid flow profiles, whereby highly inhomogeneous flow patterns emerged. These inhomogeneous flow patterns may induce deformation of cytoskeletal elements in the osteocyte process, thereby amplifying mechanical signals. Based on these observations, new and realistic models can be developed that will significantly enhance our understanding of the process of mechanotransduction in bone.

Primary and secondary ossification centers (SOCs), which form the diaphysis and the epiphysis of long bones, respectively, are formed by endochondral and intramembranous ossification processes. During skeletal maturation, the SOCs may appear irregular and fragmented, which should not be confused with fractures, osteochondritis dissecans, and osteochondrosis. These normal irregularities are generally symmetric with a smooth, round, and sclerotic appearance, which are aspects that help in the differentiation. The metaphysis, epiphysis, and growth plates or physes are common sites of injuries and normal variants in the pediatric skeleton. The metaphysis contains the newly formed bone from endochondral ossification and is highly vascularized. It is predisposed to easy spread of infections and bone tumors. The physis is the weakest structure of the immature skeleton. Injuries to this location may disrupt endochondral ossification and lead to growth disturbances. Pathologic conditions of the epiphyses may extend into the articular surface and lead to articular damage. At MRI, small and localized foci of bone marrow changes within the epiphysis and metaphysis are also a common finding. These can be related to residual red marrow (especially in the metaphysis of long bones and hindfoot), focal periphyseal edema (associated with the process of physeal closure), and ultimately to a normal ossification process. The authors review the imaging appearance of normal skeletal maturation and discuss common maturation disorders on the basis of developmental stage and location. ©RSNA, 2022.

Detecting such microdamage is difficult as pre‐existing microdamage sustained in vivo must be differentiated from artefactual damage incurred during specimen preparation. This was addressed by bulk staining specimens in alcohol‐soluble basic fuchsin dye, but cutting and grinding them in an aqueous medium. Nonetheless, some artefactual cracks are partially stained and careful observation under transmitted light, or epifluorescence microscopy, is required. Fuchsin lodges in cracks, but is not site‐specific. Cracks are discontinuities in the calcium‐rich bone matrix and chelating agents, which bind calcium, can selectively label them. Oxytetracycline, alizarin complexone, calcein, calcein blue and xylenol orange all selectively bind microcracks and, as they fluoresce at different wavelengths and colours, can be used in sequence to label microcrack growth. New agents that only fluoresce when involved in a chelate are currently being developed – fluorescent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) sensors. Such agents enable microdamage to be quantified and crack growth to be measured and are useful histological tools in providing data for modelling the material behaviour of bone. However, a non‐invasive method is needed to measure microdamage in patients. Micro‐CT is being studied and initial work with iodine dyes linked to a chelating group has shown some promise. In the long term, it is hoped that repeated measurements can be made at critical sites and microdamage accumulation monitored. Quantification of microdamage, together with bone mass measurements, will help in predicting and preventing bone fracture failure in patients with osteoporosis.

Recent advancements in skeletal imaging via High-Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) allows for the in vivo 3-dimensional and longitudinal quantification of bone density, microarchitecture, geometry, and parameters of mechanical strength in response to varying strain stimuli including those resulting from exercise or military training. Further, the voxel size of 61 microns has the potential to capture subtle changes in human bone in as little as 8 weeks. Given the typical time course of bone remodeling, short-term detection of skeletal changes in bone microstructure and morphology is indicative of adaptive bone formation, the deposition of new bone formation, uncoupled from prior resorption, that can occur at mechanistically advantageous regions. This review aims to synthesize existing training-induced HR-pQCT data in three distinct populations of healthy adults excluding disease states, pharmacological intervention and nutritional supplementation. Those included are: 1) military basic or officer training 2) general population and 3) non-osteoporotic aging. This review aims to further identify similarities and contrasts with prior modalities and cumulatively interpret results within the scope of bone functional adaptation.

Bazzocchi;2023;073ed527eee98929b52f2c53a063a60ae6158160;High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography: research or clinical practice?;High-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) is a low-dose three-dimensional imaging technique, originally developed for in vivo assessment of bone microarchitecture at the distal radius and tibia in osteoporosis. HR-pQCT has the ability to discriminate trabecular and cortical bone compartments, providing densitometric and structural parameters. At present, HR-pQCT is mostly used in research settings, despite evidence showing that it may be a valuable tool in osteoporosis and other diseases. This review summarizes the main applications of HR-pQCT and addresses the limitations that currently prevent its integration into routine clinical practice. In particular, the focus is on the use of HR-pQCT in primary and secondary osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD), endocrine disorders affecting bone, and rare diseases. A section on novel potential applications of HR-pQCT is also present, including assessment of rheumatic diseases, knee osteoarthritis, distal radius/scaphoid fractures, vascular calcifications, effect of medications, and skeletal muscle. The reviewed literature seems to suggest that a more widespread implementation of HR-pQCT in clinical practice would offer notable opportunities. For instance, HR-pQCT can improve the prediction of incident fractures beyond areal bone mineral density provided by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. In addition, HR-pQCT may be used for the monitoring of anti-osteoporotic therapy or for the assessment of mineral and bone disorder associated with CKD. Nevertheless, several obstacles currently prevent a broader use of HR-pQCT and would need to be targeted, such as the small number of installed machines worldwide, the uncertain cost-effectiveness, the need for improved reproducibility, and the limited availability of reference normative data sets.

Beside effects of the model size, scan/analysis resolution, segmentation process, etc., the type of the applied boundary conditions (BCs) have a strong influence on the predicted elastic properties. Appropriate BCs have to be applied on hexahedral digital finite element models in order to obtain effective elastic properties. Homogeneous displacement BCs as proposed by Van Rietbergen et al. (J Biomech 29(12):1653–1657, 1996) lead to “apparent” rather than to “effective” elastic properties. This study provides some answers concerning such differences by comparing various BC types (uniform displacement, mixed BCs, periodic BCs), different volume element definitions (original and mirrored models), and several bone volume fractions (BVTV ranging from 6.5 to 37.6%). First, the mixed BCs formulated by Hazanov (Arch Appl Mech 68(6):385–394, 1998) are theoretically extended to shear loading of a porous media. Second, six human bone samples are analyzed, their orthotropic Young’s moduli, shear moduli, and Poisson’s ratios computed and compared. It is found that the proposed mixed BCs give exactly the same effective elastic properties as periodic BCs if a periodic and orthotropic micro-structured material is used and thus denoted as “periodicity compatible” mixed uniform BCs (PMUBCs). As bone samples were shown to be nearly orthotropic for volume element side lengths ≥5 mm the proposed mixed BCs turn out to be the best choice because they give again essentially the same overall elastic properties as periodic BCs. For bone samples of smaller dimensions ( < 5 mm) with a strong anisotropy (beyond orthotropy) uniform displacement BCs remain applicable but they can significantly overestimate the effective stiffness

In general, trabecular bone material properties are scaled with computer tomography (CT) density alone, without accounting for local variations in anisotropy or micro-architecture. Moreover, the cortex is often omitted or assigned with a constant thickness. In this work, voxel FE models, as well as surface-based homogenized FE models with topologically-conformed geometry and assigned with experimentally validated properties for bone, were developed from a series of 12 specimens tested up to failure. The effects of changing from a digital mesh to a smooth mesh, including a cortex of variable thickness and/or including heterogeneous trabecular fabric, were investigated. In each case, FE predictions of vertebral stiffness and strength were compared with the experimental gold-standard, and changes in elastic strain energy density and damage distributions were reported. The results showed that a smooth mesh effectively removed zones of artificial damage locations occurring in the ragged edges of the digital mesh. Adding an explicit cortex stiffened and strengthened the models, unloading the trabecular centrum while increasing the correlations to experimental stiffness and strength. Further addition of heterogeneous fabric improved the correlations to stiffness (R(2)=0.72) and strength (R(2)=0.89) and moved the damage locations closer to the vertebral endplates, following the local trabecular orientations. It was furthermore demonstrated that predictions of vertebral stiffness and strength of homogenized FE models with topologically-conformed cortical shell and heterogeneous trabecular fabric correlated well with experimental measurements, after assigning purely experimental data for bone without further calibration of material laws at the macroscale of bone. This study successfully demonstrated the limitations of current classical FE methods and provided valuable insights into the damage mechanisms of vertebral bodies.

Although several validation studies have been performed on specific anatomical sites and load cases, this study aims to review the predictability of human bone strength at the three major osteoporotic fracture sites quantified in recently completed in vitro studies at our former institute. Specifically, the performance of FE analysis based on clinical computer tomography (QCT) is compared with the ones of the current densitometric standards, bone mineral content, bone mineral density (BMD) and areal BMD (aBMD). Clinical fractures were produced in monotonic axial compression of the distal radii, vertebral sections and in side loading of the proximal femora. QCT-based FE models of the three bones were developed to simulate as closely as possible the boundary conditions of each experiment. For all sites, the FE methodology exhibited the lowest errors and the highest correlations in predicting the experimental bone strength. Likely due to the improved CT image resolution, the quality of the FE prediction in the peripheral skeleton using high-resolution peripheral CT was superior to that in the axial skeleton with whole-body QCT. Because of its projective and scalar nature, the performance of aBMD in predicting bone strength depended on loading mode and was significantly inferior to FE in axial compression of radial or vertebral sections but not significantly inferior to FE in side loading of the femur. Considering the cumulated evidence from the published validation studies, it is concluded that FE models provide the most reliable surrogates of bone strength at any of the three fracture sites

Its clinical potential has recently been endorsed by the International Society of Clinical Densitometry Zysset et al. (J Clin Densitom 18(3):359–92, 2015). In vitro validation studies demonstrated the superiority of FEA over DXA for the prediction of ultimate load. In vivo studies confirmed the superiority in the spine, but data were less conclusive in the hip and forearm. Here, in addition to low bone strength the risk of falling is a major determinant of fracture risk. The next level of FEA dissemination, the integration into clinical practice, still faces a number of challenges such as access to dedicated FE software and its integration into the clinical workflow. Also compared to DXA, current FEA techniques have not shown a consistent superiority for hip fracture prediction, while hip CT is associated with a higher radiation exposure than hip DXA. For many clinicians, FEA and the direct measurement of strength instead of BMD are a novel perspective. However, the increasing use of abdominal and pelvic CT scans initially obtained for other clinical diagnosis, for the secondary use to assess osteoporosis and fracture risk (opportunistic screening), may accelerate the use of FEA. In this contribution, the basic technical aspects and limitation of FEA are discussed and the clinically relevant outcome measures are presented. Further advanced topics will broaden the understanding of the various aspects of FEA. Afterward a summary of in vivo studies using FEA for fracture prediction is given, which also includes a discussion of the clinical value of FEA for bone strength measurements

Grimal;2019;e58af76db93c4d6bec95867ae5b7ee77fbc6afc1;Homogenization of cortical bone reveals that the organization and shape of pores marginally affect elasticity;With ageing and various diseases, the vascular pore volume fraction (porosity) in cortical bone increases, and the morphology of the pore network is altered. Cortical bone elasticity is known to decrease with increasing porosity, but the effect of the microstructure is largely unknown, while it has been thoroughly studied for trabecular bone. Also, popular micromechanical models have disregarded several micro-architectural features, idealizing pores as cylinders aligned with the axis of the diaphysis. The aim of this paper is to quantify the relative effects on cortical bone anisotropic elasticity of porosity and other descriptors of the pore network micro-architecture associated with pore number, size and shape. The five stiffness constants of bone assumed to be a transversely isotropic material were measured with resonant ultrasound spectroscopy in 55 specimens from the femoral diaphysis of 29 donors. The pore network, imaged with synchrotron radiation X-ray micro-computed tomography, was used to derive the pore descriptors and to build a homogenization model using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. The model was calibrated using experimental elasticity. A detailed analysis of the computed effective elasticity revealed in particular that porosity explains most of the variations of the five stiffness constants and that the effects of other micro-architectural features are small compared to usual experimental errors. We also have evidence that modelling the pore network as an ensemble of cylinders yields biased elasticity values compared to predictions based on the real micro-architecture. The FFT homogenization method is shown to be particularly efficient to model cortical bone.

For the past 50 years, finite element modeling has been used to investigate the relationships between bone geometry, material properties, and mechanical loading conditions. This review examines how we use finite element modeling in the context of bone mechanoadpatation. Finite element models estimate complex mechanical stimuli at the tissue and cellular levels, help explain experimental results, and inform the design of loading protocols and prosthetics. FE modeling is a powerful tool to study bone adaptation as it complements experimental approaches. Before using FE models, researchers should determine whether simulation results will provide complementary information to experimental or clinical observations and should establish the level of complexity required. As imaging technics and computational capacity continue increasing, we expect FE models to help in designing treatments of bone pathologies that take advantage of mechanoadaptation of bone

That mechanism could be named a mechanostat. Accumulated evidence suggests it includes the bone itself, plus mechanisms that transform its mechanical usage into appropriate signals, plus other mechanisms that detect those signals and then direct the above three biologic activities. In vivo studies have shown that bone strains in or above the 1500–3000 microstrain range cause bone modelling to increase cortical bone mass, while strains below the 100–300 microstrain range release BMU‐based remodeling which then removes existing cortical‐endosteal and trabecular bone. That arrangement provides a dual system in which bone modeling would adapt bone mass to gross overloading, while BMU‐based remodeling would adapt bone mass to gross underloading, and the above strain ranges would be the approximate “setpoints” of those responses.

They derive from osteoblasts through a complex series of morpho-functional modifications; such modifications not only concern the cell shape (from prismatic to dendritic) and location (along the vascular bone surfaces or enclosed inside the lacuno-canalicular cavities, respectively) but also their role in bone processes (secretion/mineralization of preosseous matrix and/or regulation of bone remodeling). Osteocytes are connected with each other by means of different types of junctions, among which the gap junctions enable osteocytes inside the matrix to act in a neuronal-like manner, as a functional syncytium together with the cells placed on the vascular bone surfaces (osteoblasts or bone lining cells), the stromal cells and the endothelial cells, i.e., the bone basic cellular system (BBCS). Within the BBCS, osteocytes can communicate in two ways: by means of volume transmission and wiring transmission, depending on the type of signals (metabolic or mechanical, respectively) received and/or to be forwarded. The capability of osteocytes in maintaining skeletal and mineral homeostasis is due to the fact that it acts as a mechano-sensor, able to transduce mechanical strains into biological signals and to trigger/modulate the bone remodeling, also because of the relevant role of sclerostin secreted by osteocytes, thus regulating different bone cell signaling pathways. The authors want to emphasize that the present review is centered on the morphological aspects of the osteocytes that clearly explain their functional implications and their role as bone orchestrators."
